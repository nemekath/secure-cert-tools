# GitHub Actions Flask-Limiter Fix Summary

## Issue
GitHub Actions build for Python 3.11 was failing with:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask_limiter'
```

## Root Cause
The `requirements-dev.txt` file was missing the Flask-Limiter and Flask-WTF security dependencies that are imported in `app.py`. The GitHub Actions workflow installs `requirements-dev.txt`, but these modules were only included in `requirements.txt`.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated requirements-dev.txt
Added missing security dependencies and their transitive dependencies:
- `Flask-Limiter==3.8.0` - Rate limiting for DoS protection
- `Flask-WTF==1.2.1` - CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- `limits==5.4.0` - Required by Flask-Limiter
- `ordered-set==4.1.0` - Required by Flask-Limiter
- `rich==13.9.4` - Required by Flask-Limiter
- `WTForms==3.2.1` - Required by Flask-WTF
- `deprecated>=1.2.0` - Required by limits
- `markdown-it-py>=3.0.0` - Required by rich

### 2. Updated requirements.txt
Added transitive dependencies to ensure consistency across environments:
- Added same dependencies with `>=` version constraints for production flexibility

## Verification
âœ… **flask_limiter imports successfully**
âœ… **flask_wtf imports successfully**
âœ… **app.py can be imported without ModuleNotFoundError**
âœ… **pytest test collection works**
âœ… **All security dependencies available**

## GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow installs dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

This now includes all the necessary security dependencies that `app.py` imports.

## Test Commands Used
```python
# Verify core imports work
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address
from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect, validate_csrf

# Verify transitive dependencies
import limits, ordered_set, rich, wtforms
```

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **FIXED** - GitHub Actions Python 3.11 build should now pass successfully.

The ModuleNotFoundError for flask_limiter has been resolved by ensuring all security dependencies are properly included in requirements-dev.txt.
