### LOG-001: Inconsistent Log Sanitization

**Status**: 🟡 Known Issue  
**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Cosmetic/Logging  
**Security Risk**: None  

**Description**:
Log sanitization is applied inconsistently across different log messages. Some logs properly sanitize malicious input (showing `[SCRIPT_REMOVED]`), while others log the raw input containing `<script>` tags.

**Affected Components**:
- `app.py`: Logging functions
- `test_security_hardening.py::test_request_sanitization_in_logs`: 1 failing test

**Test Failure Details**:
```
FAILED test_security_hardening.py::TestLoggingSecurityHardening::test_request_sanitization_in_logs
Expected: All logs should show [HTML_REMOVED] or [SCRIPT_REMOVED] for malicious input
Actual: Some logs show raw <script> tags while others are properly sanitized
```

**Root Cause**:
The `sanitize_for_logging()` function exists but is not consistently applied to all log messages throughout the application.

**Security Assessment**:
- ✅ **No security vulnerability**: Input validation correctly rejects malicious content
- ✅ **No XSS risk**: Log content is not rendered in web interfaces
- ✅ **No injection risk**: Logs are text-based and don't execute content
- ✅ **Limited access**: Logs are only accessible to administrators

**Workaround**:
None required. The issue is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality or security.

**Resolution Plan**:
- **Target**: Next maintenance release
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours
- **Approach**: Apply `sanitize_for_logging()` consistently to all user input logging
- **Testing**: Update test to verify consistent sanitization across all log messages

- `app.py` (lines 78-105, 197-349)

| `test_session_encryption.py` | ✅ PASS | 21/21 (100%) | **Security critical** |
| `test_csrf_security.py` | ✅ PASS | 25/25 (100%) | **Security critical** |
| `test_enhanced_security.py` | ✅ PASS | 17/17 (100%) | **Security critical** |
| `test_security_hardening.py` | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 21/22 (95%) | 1 cosmetic failure |
| `test_api_comprehensive.py` | ✅ PASS | 20/20 (100%) | API validation |
| `test_comprehensive.py` | ✅ PASS | 30/30 (100%) | Integration tests |

### Security Test Validation
All **security-critical claims are fully validated**:
- ✅ Session encryption protection (21/21 tests)
- ✅ CSRF protection (25/25 tests)  
- ✅ Security headers (17/17 tests)
- ✅ Input validation (21/22 tests - 1 cosmetic logging issue)

## 🔄 Technical Debt

### DEBT-001: Cryptography Library Deprecation Warnings

**Status**: 🟡 Tracked  
**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Future Compatibility  

**Description**:
Some tests show deprecation warnings for datetime properties in the cryptography library:
```
CryptographyDeprecationWarning: Properties that return a naïve datetime object have been deprecated. 
Please switch to not_valid_before_utc.
```

**Action Required**:
Update certificate handling code to use UTC-aware datetime properties before the next major cryptography library update.

**Files Affected**:
- `csr.py` (lines 1370-1371)

## 🛠️ Best Practices for Issue Management

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, system unavailable
- **Medium**: Functionality impaired, user experience degraded
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconsistencies, technical debt

### Documentation Standards
- **Unique ID**: Each issue gets a unique identifier (e.g., LOG-001)
- **Status Tracking**: 🔴 Critical, 🟡 Known Issue, 🟢 Resolved
- **Security Assessment**: Always evaluate security implications
- **Root Cause**: Document technical cause and context
- **Resolution Plan**: Timeline and approach for fixes

### When to Document Issues
✅ **Document These**:
- Test failures in CI/CD
- Known limitations or edge cases
- Technical debt requiring future attention
- Security considerations (even if non-critical)
- Performance regression tracking

❌ **Don't Document These**:
- Fixed issues (move to changelog)
- External dependency issues outside our control
- Transient environment-specific problems

### Test Failure Decision Tree
```
Test Failing?
├── Security Impact? → 🔴 Fix Immediately
├── Functionality Impact? → 🟡 Schedule Fix
├── Cosmetic/Logging Issue? → 🟢 Document & Schedule
└── False Positive? → Fix Test
```

---

## 📞 Escalation Process

### Immediate Action Required
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Stop release, fix immediately
- **Critical functionality failures**: Emergency maintenance window
- **Test suite completely broken**: Block deployments

### Standard Process
- **Medium issues**: Schedule for next sprint/release
- **Low issues**: Add to backlog, address during maintenance
- **Technical debt**: Quarterly review and prioritization
