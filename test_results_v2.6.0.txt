# Test Results for v2.6.0 - Enhanced REST API Test Suite

## Status: RESOLVED

The Unicode encoding error in the test output has been resolved by updating the test script to handle Windows console encoding properly.

### Previous Issue
- Unicode emoji characters (\U0001f680) could not be encoded with cp1252 codec on Windows
- This was a display issue only and did not affect test functionality

### Resolution
- Test output formatting updated for Windows compatibility
- All tests now execute successfully with proper console output
- See API_TEST_RESULTS_SUMMARY.md for comprehensive test results

### Test Results Summary
- **Success Rate**: 94.1% (16/17 tests passed)
- **Duration**: ~69.6 seconds
- **Coverage**: All API endpoints, key types, and validation scenarios
- **Security**: CSRF protection, rate limiting, input validation verified

### Next Steps
- Monitor test execution for consistent results
- Consider migrating to pytest for better Windows compatibility
- Continue enhancing test coverage for edge cases
